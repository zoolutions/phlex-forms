# LFG - Full Autonomous Workflow

Execute a complete engineering workflow with verification at each phase.

## Phase 0: Branch Setup

**BEFORE any other work, prepare the git branch:**

1. Check the current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If NOT on `main`, switch: `git checkout main`
3. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
4. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b issue-{number}-{brief-description}` (or `feature/{description}` if no issue number)

---

## Phase 1: Understand

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a GitHub issue number or URL:

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,assignees,comments
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a description, use it directly.

**Keep the issue's `type` and `area` labels** — Phase 7 puts them on the pull request. `/lfg` never edits the issue's own labels; the issue's lifecycle is the user's to manage. A `docs/plans/*.md` plan carries them on its `Labels:` line. If either group is missing, or you were given a description, pin the `type` now (one, per `.github/LABELS.md`); the areas come from the actual changed paths when the PR is opened, via `bin/labels infer`.

### Step 2: Define Acceptance Criteria

**MANDATORY:** Write explicit acceptance criteria:

- **GIVEN** [context/setup]
- **WHEN** [action taken]
- **THEN** [expected outcome]

You MUST NOT proceed until you can articulate these clearly.

### Step 3: Comprehension Gate

Before proceeding, you must:

1. State the problem/feature in one sentence
2. Explain WHY this is needed (the user-facing payoff — a model-bound form that infers the right control and renders under any theme, written once)
3. List what changes from a host app's perspective (the `field` / builder / config API delta)
4. Identify edge cases not explicitly mentioned
5. Explain the flow: `PhlexForms.configure` → `Builder#field` asks `PhlexForms::Inference` for the control type → `PhlexForms::Theme` maps the role to a `Forms::*` leaf → the leaf delegates markup to the daisyui gem (or a `Forms::Plain::*` fallback) → the host gets model-bound HTML. Which link changes?

If you cannot complete ALL five items, investigate further.

### Step 4: Create Task List

Create a TaskCreate todo list with specific implementation steps.

---

## Phase 2: Explore

1. Find related files (Glob/Grep or Explore agent with `model: haiku`)
2. Read existing patterns in similar leaf components (`lib/forms/*.rb`)
3. Understand integration points across the layers
4. Check existing test coverage in `spec/forms/**` (integration) and `spec/phlex_forms/**` (unit)
5. Review the builder surface (`lib/phlex_forms/builder.rb`) — the `field` verb + PascalCase escape hatches — and the form entry points (`lib/forms/form.rb`, `lib/forms/base.rb`)
6. Review the leaf components in `lib/forms/` (Input, Select, Textarea, Checkbox, Toggle, Radio, FileInput, …); each delegates markup to the daisyui gem via `PhlexForms::DelegatedField`
7. Review type inference (`lib/phlex_forms/inference.rb`) — the precedence order a new control-type rule must slot into
8. Review theming (`lib/phlex_forms/theme.rb` + `lib/forms/plain/`) — a new leaf role must be mapped in BOTH `Theme.daisy` and `Theme.plain`
9. Review the config surface (`lib/phlex_forms/configuration.rb`) — any globally-tunable behavior (theme, `infer_from_model`, `field_variants`, `icon_renderer`) goes here
10. Review the engine (`lib/phlex_forms/engine.rb`) — optional Rails wiring: importmap, i18n load path, the `Forms::Live` param type; and the live/reactive surface (`lib/forms/live.rb`, `app/javascript/phlex_forms/controllers/validations/`)

---

## Phase 3: Plan

1. List files to modify with specific changes
2. List new files to create with purpose
3. Identify the config default vs. per-call override (globally-tunable behavior goes on `Configuration`; per-form/per-class options go through the builder)
4. Plan test coverage across layers (TDD: tests FIRST) — config default, inference precedence, leaf render, theme parity
5. Update the task list
6. Consider backwards compatibility (hosts that never configure, and existing form classes, must keep working verbatim)
7. If the change adds a leaf, plan the theme mapping in BOTH `Theme.daisy` and `Theme.plain`; if it's live/reactive, plan the soft phlex-reactive guard and any `Engine` initializer

---

## Phase 4: Implement (TDD)

### The deviation log (keep it from the first edit)

The plan is the map; the codebase is the territory. The moment reality forces a choice the plan or issue didn't settle, log it in `implementation-notes.md` at the repo root — one line, at the moment it happens, not reconstructed later:

- **Deviations** — the plan said X, you did Y, because Z
- **Discoveries** — facts about the codebase the plan didn't know
- **Judgment calls** — choices the user might have made differently (defaults, naming, scope cuts)

Pick the conservative option and keep going. The log is how the user audits your judgment afterwards. Never commit the file: its contents move into the PR body, then the file is deleted.

For each logical unit:

### 4.1: Write Failing Test First

```bash
bundle exec rspec <spec_file>
```

### 4.2: Implement Minimum Code

Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass. Follow project patterns:

| Never Do | Always Do |
|----------|-----------|
| Hand-write raw daisyUI markup in a leaf | Delegate to the daisyui gem via `PhlexForms::DelegatedField` |
| Hardcode a globally-tunable value in a component | Read it from `PhlexForms.config` |
| Add a daisy leaf and forget the plain one | Map the role in BOTH `Theme.daisy` and `Theme.plain` |
| Add an inference rule ahead of an explicit option | Respect precedence: caller-passed `as:`/options always win |
| Hard-require phlex-reactive | Guard `Forms::Live` behind `defined?(Phlex::Reactive)` |
| Break the leaf initializer signature | Keep `(*modifiers, name:, id:, value:, error:, required:, ...)` — it's the theme seam |
| Fabricate a model to test against | Build a real ActiveModel double with `build_model` (column types/enums/validators drive inference) |

### 4.3: Refactor

Once green, refactor while keeping tests passing.

### 4.4: Validate

```bash
bundle exec rubocop lib spec
```

### 4.5: Repeat

Move to the next unit. Mark task items complete.

---

## Phase 5: Deep Root Cause Analysis (Bug Fixes Only)

**If this is a bug fix, investigate before implementing.**

### Trace the lifecycle

For the failing behavior:
- Did it originate in inference (wrong control type), in a leaf's render (wrong markup/variants), in the theme map (missing role, daisy/plain drift), or in config (a default nothing reads)?
- Is it a server-render bug or a client-enhancement bug (does it reproduce with the Stimulus validation / `Forms::Live` disabled)?
- What ASSUMPTIONS does the code make at the failure point? Which was violated, and WHY?

### Use git history

```bash
git log --oneline -20 <file>
git blame <file>
```

### Map all callers

Use Grep to find every call site. Does the bug happen only for a certain model
shape (a boolean column, an enum, a `belongs_to`)? Only under the plain theme?
Only when a host overrides a default (`infer_from_model = false`, custom
`field_variants`)?

### Five Whys

Keep asking WHY until you reach the real fix point.

### Fix-location principle

The best fix is usually NOT where the error surfaced:
- Wrong control inferred → the precedence order in `PhlexForms::Inference`, not a special case in the leaf
- Plain theme renders wrong → the `Theme.plain` mapping or the `Forms::Plain::*` leaf, not a branch in the daisy leaf
- Missing `*-error` class → `DelegatedField#daisy_modifiers`, not an inline class hack
- Variant not applied → the `field_variants` stacking order (global → form → call-site), not a per-call override

### Unacceptable superficial fixes — DO NOT DO THESE

- `rescue nil` / bare `rescue` to silence an error you don't understand
- `&.` to paper over a nil without finding why it's nil
- `return if x.nil?` to silently skip
- swallowing errors instead of logging + fixing the cause

**These HIDE bugs. Find the EARLIEST point you could prevent the error and fix there.**

---

## Phase 6: Verify

**ALL of these must pass before committing:**

```bash
bundle exec rubocop lib spec
bundle exec rspec
```

### Solution verification

- "If I were the requester, is this fully resolved?"
- "Did I fix the ROOT CAUSE, not the symptom?"
- "Do the tests prove it?"
- "Does every existing host app and form class still work verbatim (backwards compatible)?"
- "If the change needs setup, is it documented in the README (and wired into the `PhlexForms::Engine` initializer if it's a live/reactive concern)?"

---

## Phase 6.5: Fable validation

Spawn the `fable-validator` agent (it is pinned to Fable) with the issue, the acceptance criteria from Phase 1 and the base branch. On **BLOCK**, fix every blocker (back to Phase 4 for code, with a failing test first), re-verify, and run the validator again. On **PASS WITH NOTES**, fix the risks you agree with (if those fixes change the diff, re-verify and run the validator again) and list the rest in the pull request under "Accepted risks". Put the validator's one-line verdict and its "Not verified" list in the pull request body. Do not open the pull request before a PASS or PASS WITH NOTES.

---

## Phase 7: Commit & PR

### Commit

```bash
git add <specific_files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(scope): brief description

## Summary
[What changed and why]

## Test Coverage
- spec 1: validates X
- spec 2: validates the config-driven default

## Verification
- [x] bundle exec rubocop lib spec passes
- [x] bundle exec rspec passes
EOF
)"
```

### Push & PR

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)

gh pr create --title "feat(scope): brief description" --label <type> --label <area> [--label <area>…] --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
```

**Label the PR — every time.** The `--label` flags are the issue's `type` + `area` labels from Phase 1, never a `status` label (`plan`, `epic`, …). For a description-only run, infer them: one `type` (`.github/LABELS.md` maps conventional-commit prefixes to types) plus `bin/labels infer $(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD)`. Exactly one type, at least one area: when `infer` prints nothing (changes confined to unmapped paths such as specs, the README or the Gemfile), pick the closest area by hand — never zero. `gh pr create` fails on a label that doesn't exist on GitHub: run `bin/labels sync` first, then re-run the create (`gh pr edit <n> --add-label …` labels a PR that is already open, once the labels exist).

Write the PR body to a temp file (`--body-file`) to avoid shell-interpolation of
backticks/tables. The body is copied verbatim — if you would not type a
backslash in a GitHub comment, do not type one in the heredoc.

**The PR body MUST contain a GitHub closing keyword for every issue it
resolves** — `Closes #12`, `Fixes #13`, `Resolves #9` (one per issue; only these
keywords auto-close, and `Refs #12` does NOT). Put them in the Summary so the
issues close automatically when the PR merges to the default branch. This works
with squash-merge; a keyword only in a commit body can be lost when commits are
squashed, so the PR body is the reliable place. For a multi-issue PR, list every
one: `Closes #9, closes #10, closes #11` (repeat the keyword — `Closes #9, #10`
only closes #9).

The PR body MUST also end with a `## Deviations & judgment calls` section copied
from `implementation-notes.md` (then delete the file). If the plan held
completely, write "None — the plan held." This section is read FIRST in review —
it is the audit trail for every decision the plan didn't make.

If a PR ever merges without the keyword (issues stay open), close them manually
with `gh issue close <n> --reason completed --comment "Fixed in #<pr> (merged)."`.

---

## Phase 8: Comprehension Close-Out

The tests prove the CODE is right; this phase keeps the USER's mental model right. After the PR is up, end your final message with:

1. **The decisions, not the diff** — the 3–5 non-obvious choices in this change someone must understand to maintain it. Lead with anything from the deviation log; the user has never seen those.
2. **Three merge-gate questions** the user should be able to answer before merging. If any answer isn't obvious to them, offer a walkthrough — an unanswerable question is comprehension debt, and merging anyway is how it compounds.
